    Hi - Iâ€™m Paul
    <br><br>
    I have been interested in coding for a long time and this year decided to change careers from science to computer programming.
    <br><br>
    I graduated in 2012 with a Masters in Biochemistry from Oxford University and then worked as an analytical chemist for two major pharmaceutical companies (Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline). In October 2019 I decided to leave the pharmaceutical industry and devote myself full-time to learning how to code.
    <br><br>
    So far I have been learning HTML, CSS and Javascript via various online platforms (Coursera, codecademy and freeCodeCamp) and now I am looking to attend a bootcamp to increase the depth of my knowledge and improve my employability. I feel that learning directly from others in person would also suit my learning style better than learning from online tutorials.
    <br><br>
    I first heard about Founders and Coders from a friend of mine who is a Founders and Coders alumni and he highly recommended the course. In particular, he impressed upon me that his experience of teaching others how to code in Israel was a great way to reinforce the concepts that he learnt on the course. I have heard many great things about the collaborative and supportive nature of the Founders and Coders community and I know this is something I would love to be a part of.
    <br><br>
    Besides coding, I also enjoy travelling and producing electronic music. Below you will find a sample of a few photos I took on a recent trip to Bucharest, Romania!
